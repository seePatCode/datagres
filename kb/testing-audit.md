# Datagres Testing Infrastructure Audit

## Executive Summary

The current testing infrastructure shows **significant gaps in code coverage** with most features either untested or only partially tested. While the test infrastructure is well-configured with modern tools (Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E), actual test implementation is severely lacking.

### Key Findings
- **Unit Test Coverage: ~20-30%** (estimated based on test failures and limited test files)
- **E2E Test Coverage: ~40%** (basic user flows only)
- **Critical Features Without Tests: 80%+**
- **Test Execution Status:**
  - Unit Tests: **11 of 103 tests failing** (89% pass rate)
  - E2E Tests: **40 of 42 tests failing** (5% pass rate)
  - Primary issue: Tests expect auto-connection behavior that isn't working

## Testing Infrastructure Overview

### Test Frameworks
1. **Unit Testing**: Vitest 3.2.2
   - Configuration: `vitest.config.mjs`
   - Environment: happy-dom
   - Coverage Provider: V8

2. **E2E Testing**: Playwright 1.52.0
   - Configuration: `playwright.config.js`
   - Timeout: 5 seconds
   - Workers: 1 (no parallelization)

### Test Commands
- `npm test` - Run E2E tests
- `npm test:unit` - Run unit tests
- `npm test:unit:coverage` - Run unit tests with coverage
- `npm test:headed` - Run E2E tests with visible browser

## Test Failure Analysis

### Unit Test Failures (11 of 103 failing - 89% pass rate)
1. **AI Service Tests** (5 failures)
   - Missing Ollama mock implementation
   - Settings store initialization errors: "Please specify the `projectName` option"
   - Network request mocking issues

2. **Database Service Tests** (1 failure)
   - Mock data structure mismatch

3. **Formatter Tests** (5 failures)
   - JSON pretty-printing expectations
   - Date formatting issues

### E2E Test Failures (40 of 42 failing - 5% pass rate)
1. **Window Title Test**
   - Expected: "Datagres - Database Explorer"
   - Received: "" (empty title)

2. **Auto-Connection Tests** (majority of failures)
   - Tests expect "Connected to testdb" text
   - Auto-connection feature appears broken
   - Connection UI elements not found
   - Tables view never appears

3. **Test Infrastructure Issues**
   - Tests timeout after 5 seconds waiting for elements
   - Mock test mode may not be properly initialized

### Root Causes
- **Missing Test Environment Setup**: ElectronStore requires projectName
- **Inadequate Mocking**: External dependencies not properly mocked
- **Broken Auto-Connection**: E2E tests expect auto-connection that isn't working
- **Window Title Issue**: App window has no title set
- **Test Mode Detection**: NODE_ENV=test may not be properly detected

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)
1. **Fix Failing Tests**
   - Add proper ElectronStore mocking
   - Create Ollama service mocks
   - Update test expectations

2. **Critical Feature Tests**
   - Connection management (security critical)
   - Data editing (data integrity)
   - SQL execution (core functionality)

### Short-term Goals (Priority 2)
1. **Increase Unit Test Coverage**
   - Target 80% coverage for services
   - Focus on business logic
   - Add integration tests for IPC communication

2. **Expand E2E Tests**
   - Complete user workflows
   - Error scenarios
   - Performance testing

### Long-term Strategy (Priority 3)
1. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Add mutation testing
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Visual regression tests
   - Accessibility tests

2. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Automated test runs
   - Coverage reporting
   - Test result tracking

## Coverage Gaps by Priority

### üî¥ Critical (Security/Data Integrity)
- Connection string handling
- Password storage
- SQL injection prevention
- Data update operations
- Authentication flows

### üü° High (Core Features)
- SQL editor functionality
- Query execution
- Schema operations
- Table navigation
- Search functionality

### üü¢ Medium (UX/Performance)
- Theme switching
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Export/Import
- Settings management
- Update notifications

## Testing Best Practices Not Followed

1. **No Test-Driven Development (TDD)** evident
2. **Missing Integration Tests** between renderer/main process
3. **No Performance Tests** for large datasets
4. **No Security Tests** for SQL injection, XSS
5. **No Accessibility Tests**
6. **Inadequate Error Scenario Testing**
7. **No Regression Test Suite**

## Conclusion

The Datagres project has a solid testing infrastructure foundation but severely lacks actual test implementation. With only ~20-30% of features having any test coverage and 11% of existing tests failing, the project is at high risk for regressions and bugs in production.

**Immediate action required**: Fix failing tests and add coverage for security-critical features (connection management, data operations) before any new feature development.

**Estimated effort to reach acceptable coverage (70%)**: 2-3 developer weeks of focused test writing.
