# Redux Phase 2: Theme & SQL Settings Migration - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully migrated Theme and SQL Settings from React Context API to Redux Toolkit.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Settings Slice
- Updated `settingsSlice.ts` to load initial state from localStorage
- Added theme application logic directly in reducers
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing localStorage keys

### 2. Created New Hooks
- Created `useSettings.ts` with `useTheme()` and `useSqlSettings()` hooks
- These hooks replace the old Context API hooks with same interface
- Maintains compatibility with existing components

### 3. Added Theme Menu
- Updated `menuBuilder.js` to add View > Theme submenu
- Added theme options: Dark, Light, System (with radio buttons)
- Added theme action types to `MenuAction` type

### 4. Updated Main App
- Replaced `ThemeProvider` and `SqlSettingsProvider` with Redux Provider
- Created `ThemeInitializer` component to apply theme on mount
- Updated `main.tsx` to use new architecture

### 5. Updated Components
- Updated `sql-query-view.tsx` to use new `useSqlSettings` hook
- Updated `useMenuActions` to handle theme menu actions

### 6. Cleanup
- Moved old Context files to `_backup_contexts` directory
- Files remain available if needed but are out of the way

## Key Benefits
1. **Single Source of Truth**: All settings now in Redux store
2. **Better Persistence**: Uses existing middleware pattern
3. **Menu Integration**: Theme can now be changed from native menu
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support maintained
5. **Backward Compatible**: Uses same localStorage keys

## Testing
- Unit tests pass
- Settings persist across app restarts
- Theme changes apply immediately
- SQL live preview setting works as before

## Next Steps
- Phase 3: Migrate UI State (modals, dialogs, etc.)
- Consider adding more settings (font size, etc.) to settings slice
