# Redux Phase 3: UI State Migration - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully migrated UI state (views, dialogs, navigation) from local component state to Redux.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created UI Slice (`uiSlice.ts`)
- Manages current view (connect/explorer)
- Handles save connection dialog state
- Implements navigation history with back/forward support
- Provides clean selectors for all UI state

### 2. Created useUI Hook
- Provides simple interface to UI state and actions
- Encapsulates dispatch logic
- Maintains same API as previous implementation

### 3. Updated App.tsx
- Removed useState for currentView, showSaveDialog, pendingConnectionString
- Removed useNavigationHistory hook (replaced by Redux)
- Now uses useUI hook for all UI state management
- Simplified navigation handling

### 4. Benefits Achieved
- **Eliminated prop drilling**: No more passing navigation callbacks through multiple levels
- **Centralized state**: UI state now in single location
- **Better debugging**: Can use Redux DevTools to track UI state changes
- **Cleaner components**: App.tsx is now more focused on orchestration

## State Structure
```typescript
{
  ui: {
    currentView: 'connect' | 'explorer',
    showSaveDialog: boolean,
    pendingConnectionString: string,
    navigationHistory: NavigationEntry[],
    navigationIndex: number
  }
}
```

## Next Steps
- Phase 4: Migrate Connection State (will eliminate more prop drilling)
- Phase 5: Migrate Tab State (complex state with persistence)

The UI slice provides a solid foundation for the rest of the migration, demonstrating how Redux can simplify state management and component communication.
